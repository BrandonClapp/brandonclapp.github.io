Learning keyboard shortcuts and getting familiar with your tools are great ways to be more productive.Â Keyboard shortcuts not only minimize the amount of time that you're navigating your cursor, but also become second nature to getting around your OS, documents, and applications. Here are a few shortcuts that I use on a regular basis. I'll keep this post updated as I find myself using shortcuts that aren't documented here. Leave a comment and let me know if there are any here that you use that I've left out.
