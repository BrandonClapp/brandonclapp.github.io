        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Tom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

        <title>Benefits of Socratic Dev Team Environments</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;you-dont-know-everything&quot;&gt;You don’t know everything&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I’ve always taken the opportunity to absorb information from those who know more about particular subjects than I. Ultimately, no one knows everything and to think that one’s entire knowledge base can come from first hand experiences is absurd. Collaboration and the exchange of ideas is, in my opinion, what makes or breaks a development team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, the Sam Walton was arrested after crawling around in stores on his hands and knees. When Walton’s friends came to bail him out, he told them he’d been measuring aisle widths to determine exactly how they displayed their wares. If Sam Walton, the founder of the largest retailer in the world was willing to go to that length to learn from others then what’s your excuse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;most-things-are-highly-opinionated&quot;&gt;Most things are highly opinionated&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most things published to the internet are cat pictures and highly opinionated rants. Unfortunately, most people don’t question the source or reasoning behind such information. When researching a new technology or concept, the first thing read immediately becomes cold hard fact. Once it’s read, it must be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell into this trap last week where I read that JavaScript was multi-threaded when used with node.js. This, of course, is not true. After pondering on the idea for a while, I realized that the information that I had read didn’t add up. After having a discussion with co-workers, doing further research, and trying it on my own I had a more in depth understanding of it. Had I not have thought for myself, I would still be carrying incorrect knowledge, spreading misinformation to all who were also as ignorant of the topic as I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;asking-questions-doesnt-make-you-sound-dumb&quot;&gt;Asking question’s doesn’t make you sound dumb&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be this idea that asking questions is only for the junior developer or “one who needs guidance”. I mean, a “senior” developer would never be caught asking “THAT” question, right!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking questions helps the development team grow together. Chances are you’re not the only person that has the question (and if you are, so what?). There are too many frameworks, libraries, tools, concepts, design patterns…etc in the software development scene, that a single developer simply can not keep up with every single one of them. That being said, even if they could, they certainly would not be an expert at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration between developers is healthy. More info why it’s important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;be-weary-of-those-who-claim-to-be-experts&quot;&gt;Be weary of those who claim to be experts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…Unless they have a reputable backing of followers or have a track record of typically being a reliable source. Just as asking questions is a natural function of being human, reading an introductory article online doesn’t make someone an expert. Going through a 5 minute interactive tutorial does not constitute knowing the in’s and out’s of every details. Eliminate people with such claims from your trusted sources. Also, upgrade your BS detector.&lt;/p&gt;
